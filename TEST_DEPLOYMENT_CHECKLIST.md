# Deployment Test Checklist

## Current Status
- ✅ Code fixes pushed to GitHub (commit bc5ecab)
- ✅ Local build successful
- ❌ Site returning 404 error
- ⚠️ You said "latest deploy succeeded" but fixes not visible

## What to Check in Netlify Dashboard

### 1. Check Deploy Status
- Go to: https://app.netlify.com
- Find: "Final-Banner-Site" project
- Click: "Deploys" tab
- Look for: Latest deploy with commit `bc5ecab`
- Status should be: "Published"

### 2. Check Deploy Details
Click on the latest deploy and verify:
- ✅ Build command ran: `rm -rf dist node_modules/.vite node_modules/sharp && npm install && npm run build`
- ✅ Build succeeded (green checkmark)
- ✅ Publish directory: `dist`
- ✅ Files published: Should show `index.html` and `assets/` folder

### 3. Check Build Log
Scroll through the build log and look for:
- ✅ `npm install` completed successfully
- ✅ `npm run build` completed successfully
- ✅ Output shows: `dist/index.html`, `dist/assets/index-*.js`, `dist/assets/index-*.css`
- ❌ Any error messages (in red)
- ❌ Any warnings about missing files

### 4. Check Published Files
In the deploy details, look for "Published deploy" section:
- Should list files like:
  - `index.html`
  - `assets/index-[hash].js`
  - `assets/index-[hash].css`
  - `_redirects`
  - etc.

### 5. Common Issues

**Issue: Build succeeds but dist folder is empty**
- Check if `npm run build` actually ran
- Check if there were TypeScript errors that stopped the build
- Check if vite.config.ts has correct output directory

**Issue: Build succeeds but wrong files deployed**
- Check publish directory setting (should be `dist`)
- Check if there's a `.gitignore` preventing dist from being created

**Issue: 404 on all pages**
- Check if `_redirects` file exists in dist
- Check if SPA fallback redirect is configured
- Check if index.html exists in published files

### 6. Try Manual Redeploy
If everything looks correct but site still shows 404:
1. Go to "Deploys" tab
2. Click "Trigger deploy" button (top right)
3. Select "Clear cache and deploy site"
4. Wait for build to complete
5. Test site again

### 7. Check Site URL
Verify you're testing the correct URL:
- Production URL: https://final-banner-site.netlify.app/
- Deploy preview URL: https://deploy-preview-[number]--final-banner-site.netlify.app/

### 8. Test Specific Pages
Once site is working, test:
- https://final-banner-site.netlify.app/ (should load homepage)
- https://final-banner-site.netlify.app/my-ai-images (should load My AI Images page)
- https://final-banner-site.netlify.app/design (should load Design page)

## What to Report Back

Please provide:
1. **Deploy status**: Published / Failed / Building?
2. **Build log**: Any errors or warnings?
3. **Published files**: Does it show index.html and assets?
4. **Actual site URL**: What URL are you testing?
5. **Browser test**: What do you see when you visit the site?

## Expected Behavior After Fixes
