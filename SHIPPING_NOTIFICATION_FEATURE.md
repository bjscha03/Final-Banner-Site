# Send Shipping Notification Feature

## Overview

Added a "Send Shipping Notification" feature to the admin orders page that allows administrators to send automated shipping notification emails to customers when their orders have been shipped.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Admin Interface Enhancement**
- Added "Send Email" button next to each order in the admin orders list
- Button is only enabled/visible when:
  - A tracking number has been entered for the order
  - The shipping notification has not already been sent
- Visual feedback with loading states and success/error notifications
- Shows "Email Sent" status for orders where notifications have already been sent

### 2. **Automated Email System**
- Created new Netlify function: `send-shipping-notification.js`
- Uses existing email infrastructure with Resend API
- Sends professional HTML email with:
  - Company branding and logo
  - Order details and tracking information
  - Customer shipping address
  - Order summary with items and pricing
  - Direct tracking link to FedEx

### 3. **Database Integration**
- Added shipping notification tracking columns to orders table:
  - `shipping_notification_sent` (BOOLEAN)
  - `shipping_notification_sent_at` (TIMESTAMP)
- Prevents duplicate email sends
- Tracks when notifications were sent for audit purposes

### 4. **Order Status Management**
- Automatically updates order status to "shipped" when notification is sent
- Maintains existing order management functionality
- Preserves all current admin features

-- Create performance indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_shipping_notification_sent 
  ON orders(shipping_notification_sent);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_shipping_notification_sent_at 
  ON orders(shipping_notification_sent_at);
```
