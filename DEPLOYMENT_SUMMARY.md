## 🎯 Changes Deployed

### 1. Fixed Alignment Guide Positioning

**Problem**: The horizontal alignment guide (magenta horizontal line) was appearing way too low on the canvas, especially noticeable on mobile devices.

**Root Cause**: Incorrect offset calculation was being applied, which moved the guide far below where it should be.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the incorrect `visualCenterOffset` calculation
- Reverted to simple geometric center calculation
- The guide now appears at the banner's 50% mark
- Text snaps so its center aligns with the 50% mark

**Result**: ✅ Alignment guides now position correctly on both desktop and mobile

### 2. Added Mobile Touch Support for Text Editing

**Problem**: Users couldn't edit text on mobile devices - double-click doesn't work on touch screens.

**Solution**:
- Added `onTouchStart` event handler to detect touch events
- Implemented double-tap detection (300ms window)
- Double-tap on text element now enters edit mode
- Single tap selects and allows dragging

**Code Added**:
```typescript
const [lastTapTime, setLastTapTime] = useState(0); // Track taps

onTouchStart={(e) => {
  const now = Date.now();
  const DOUBLE_TAP_DELAY = 300; // ms
  if (lastTapTime && (now - lastTapTime) < DOUBLE_TAP_DELAY) {
    // Double tap detected - enter edit mode
    e.stopPropagation();
    setIsEditing(true);
    setLastTapTime(0);
  } else {
    // Single tap - select and start potential drag
    setLastTapTime(now);
    handleMouseDown(e as any);
  }
}}
```

**Result**: ✅ Users can now edit text on mobile by double-tapping

### 3. Improved CSS Box Model

**Change**: Added `boxSizing: 'border-box'` to text elements

**Benefit**: More consistent dimension calculations across browsers

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Alignment Guide Logic
```typescript
// Calculate text center
const textCenterXPercent = newXPercent + (textWidthPercent / 2);
const textCenterYPercent = newYPercent + (textHeightPercent / 2);

// Check if center is near 50%
if (Math.abs(textCenterYPercent - 50) < snapThreshold) {
  // Position text so its center is at 50%
  newYPercent = 50 - (textHeightPercent / 2);
  onShowHorizontalCenterGuide?.(true);
}
```

### Mobile Touch Detection
- **Double-tap window**: 300ms
- **First tap**: Records timestamp, selects element
- **Second tap within 300ms**: Enters edit mode
- **Second tap after 300ms**: Treated as new first tap
