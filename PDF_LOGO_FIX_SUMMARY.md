# PDF Logo Rendering Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

**Root Cause**: The `overlay_image` field (which stores logo/image data) was NOT being fetched from the database when retrieving orders. This meant that even though the PDF rendering code was fully implemented and working, it never received the logo data to render.

## Solution Implemented

### Files Modified

1. **netlify/functions/get-orders.cjs**
   - Added `overlay_image` field to both SQL queries (user-specific and admin view)
   - Added `print_ready_url` and `web_preview_url` fields for AI-generated images
   - These fields are now included in the JSON response sent to the admin panel

2. **netlify/functions/get-order.cjs**
   - Added `overlay_image` field to the SQL query
   - Added `print_ready_url` and `web_preview_url` fields
   - Ensures single order retrieval also includes logo data

### Changes Made

```diff
# get-orders.cjs (both queries)
+ 'print_ready_url', oi.print_ready_url,
+ 'web_preview_url', oi.web_preview_url,
  'text_elements', COALESCE(oi.text_elements, '[]'::jsonb),
+ 'overlay_image', oi.overlay_image

# get-order.cjs
+ print_ready_url,
+ web_preview_url,
  text_elements,
+ overlay_image
```

## Data Flow (Now Fixed)

1. **Design Page** → User adds logo via upload button
2. **Quote Store** → Stores `overlayImage` with: `{name, url, fileKey, position, scale, aspectRatio}`
3. **Create Order** → Saves `overlay_image` as JSONB in `order_items` table
4. **Get Orders** → ✅ NOW FETCHES `overlay_image` from database
5. **Admin Panel** → Receives `overlay_image` data in order items
6. **PDF Function** → Receives `overlayImage` in request body
7. **PDF Rendering** → Fetches image, composites onto canvas, generates PDF

## PDF Rendering Implementation (Already Working)

The PDF rendering code in `render-order-pdf.cjs` was already fully implemented:

- **Image Fetching**: Supports both Cloudinary fileKeys and direct URLs
- **Coordinate Mapping**: Converts percentage-based positions to PDF points at target DPI
- **Aspect Ratio**: Handles landscape, portrait, and square images correctly
- **Layering**: Composites overlay image on top of background using Sharp
- **Bleed Handling**: Accounts for bleed offset when positioning overlay
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully continues without overlay if fetch fails

## Testing Required

Before considering this complete, test the following scenarios:

### Critical Tests
- [ ] Order with single PNG logo → PDF renders with correct position/scale
- [ ] Order with JPEG logo → PDF renders without artifacts
- [ ] Order with multiple text elements + logo → All render correctly
- [ ] Large banner (e.g., 48" × 96") → Logo scales appropriately at 300 DPI
- [ ] AI-generated banner with logo overlay → Both background and logo render

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Logo positioned at edge of banner → Doesn't get cropped incorrectly
- [ ] Very small logo (< 5% scale) → Still visible in PDF
- [ ] Very large logo (> 80% scale) → Doesn't exceed memory limits
- [ ] Cloudinary URL with transformations → Fetches correctly
- [ ] Missing/expired logo URL → PDF generation fails gracefully with error message

## Deployment

**Status**: Changes committed to `main` branch

**Next Steps**:
1. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
2. Netlify will auto-deploy (connected to GitHub)
3. Test with real orders in production
4. Monitor Netlify function logs for any errors

## Additional Improvements Needed (Future Work)

### 1. Store `transform` and `preview_canvas_px` in Database
Currently these fields are NOT being stored during order creation, but the PDF function expects them. This could cause coordinate mapping issues.

**Action**: Add migration to create columns and update `create-order.cjs`

### 2. Add Retry Logic for Image Fetching
The current implementation has a single 8-second timeout. Add 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff.

### 3. Image Format Conversion
Add automatic conversion for WebP/AVIF/SVG to PNG/JPEG before embedding in PDF.

### 4. Increase DPI for Print Quality
Current: 100 DPI (to stay under Cloudinary 10MB limit)
Target: 300 DPI for true print quality
Solution: Implement server-side compression or use different storage for PDFs

### 5. Add Telemetry/Monitoring
Log detailed metrics for each PDF generation:
- Image fetch duration
- Composite operation duration
- Final PDF size
- Success/failure rate

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if overlay_image is in database
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='order_items' AND column_name='overlay_image';"

# Check recent orders for overlay_image data
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT id, overlay_image FROM order_items WHERE overlay_image IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;"

# Test PDF generation locally (requires order ID with logo)
curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/render-order-pdf \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"orderId":"...", "bannerWidthIn":48, "bannerHeightIn":96, ...}'
```
