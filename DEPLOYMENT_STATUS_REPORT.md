## ❌ NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT ISSUE

### Current Status:
**Site URL:** https://final-banner-site.netlify.app/
**HTTP Status:** 404 Not Found
**Issue:** Site is completely down

### Timeline:
1. **Previous Session:** Site was returning 404
2. **Current Session:** Fixed code issues, pushed to GitHub
3. **Netlify Auto-Deploy:** Should have triggered
4. **Current Status:** Still returning 404 (30 seconds after push)

### Possible Causes:
1. **Netlify Build Failure** - Build may be failing on Netlify servers
2. **Deployment Configuration** - netlify.toml may have issues
3. **Account/Billing Issue** - Netlify account may have problems
4. **Build Timeout** - Build may be taking longer than expected
5. **Environment Variables** - Missing environment variables on Netlify

## 🔍 WHAT YOU NEED TO CHECK

### Step 1: Check Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Find "Final-Banner-Site" project
3. Click on "Deploys" tab
4. Look for the latest deployment (should be from commit `2acc505`)

### Step 2: Check Deployment Status
Look for one of these statuses:
- **Building** - Deployment in progress (wait a few more minutes)
- **Failed** - Build failed (check build logs)
- **Success** - Build succeeded but site still 404 (configuration issue)
- **Queued** - Waiting to build (wait)

### Step 3: Check Build Logs
If deployment failed:
1. Click on the failed deployment
2. Scroll through the build logs
3. Look for error messages (usually in red)
4. Common errors:
   - Missing environment variables
   - npm install failures
   - Build command failures
   - Out of memory errors

### Step 4: Check Site Settings
1. Go to "Site settings" tab
2. Check "Build & deploy" section
3. Verify:
   - Build command: `rm -rf dist node_modules/.vite node_modules/sharp && npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: `20`

### Step 5: Check Environment Variables
1. Go to "Site settings" > "Environment variables"
2. Verify all required variables are set:
   - `DATABASE_URL` or `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `FAL_KEY`
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
   - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`
   - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `PAYPAL_MODE`
