# 🐛 Critical Bug Fixed - Preview Reset Issue

## The Problem

The preview image wasn't clearing after adding items to cart, and `resetDesign()` was never being called.

## Root Cause Discovered

The `addFromQuote()` function was being called with **wrong parameters**:

### Function Signature:
```typescript
addFromQuote: (quote: QuoteState, aiMetadata?: any, pricing?: AuthoritativePricing)
```

### How it was being called (WRONG):
```typescript
addFromQuote(pricing);  // ❌ Passing pricing as the quote parameter!
```

This caused the function to fail silently because it was trying to use the `pricing` object as if it were the `quote` object, which caused errors that prevented the rest of the code (including `resetDesign()`) from executing.

## The Fix (Commit: ed56ead)

Changed the call to pass the correct parameters:

```typescript
addFromQuote(quote, undefined, pricing);  // ✅ Correct!
```

Now the function receives:
1. `quote` - The full quote state object (correct)
2. `undefined` - No AI metadata
3. `pricing` - The authoritative pricing data

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

After Netlify finishes deploying (2-3 minutes):

1. Upload an image to the design area
2. Click "Add to Cart"
3. ✅ Toast appears: "Added to Cart"
4. ✅ **Preview area should now clear completely**
5. ✅ All design fields reset to defaults
6. ✅ Console shows the 🔄 RESET logs

## Console Logs You Should See

```
�� RESET: About to call resetDesign() after add
🔄 RESET: Current file before reset: {url: "...", ...}
🔄 QUOTE STORE: resetDesign() called
🔄 QUOTE STORE: Setting file to undefined
🔄 RESET: resetDesign() called
🔄 RESET: Current file after reset: undefined
🔄 PREVIEW USEEFFECT: File changed, file is now: undefined
🔄 PREVIEW USEEFFECT: File is undefined, resetting image state
🔄 PREVIEW USEEFFECT: Image state reset complete
```

## Testing

Please test after deployment and confirm:
- ✅ Preview clears after adding to cart
- ✅ Design fields reset to defaults
- ✅ No errors in console (except the database auth errors which we'll fix next)

---

## Next Steps

Once this is confirmed working, I'll:
1. Update the cart sync code to use the new Netlify Functions
2. Fix the database authentication errors
3. Enable secure cross-device cart synchronization
