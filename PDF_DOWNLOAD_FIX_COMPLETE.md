# PDF Download Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Identified

When downloading PDFs from the admin panel, Adobe Acrobat displayed the error:
```
"Adobe Acrobat could not open 'order-af31577e-58c0-45f3-967d-f81f32574316-banner-1.pdf' 
because it is not a supported file type or because the file has been damaged 
(for example, it was sent as an email attachment and wasn't correctly decoded)."
```

## Root Cause

The PDF rendering function (`render-order-pdf-background.cjs`) was converting the generated PDF to a **base64-encoded data URL** instead of uploading it to Cloudinary.

This data URL was being stored in the database and used as the download link. When the browser tried to download this data URL, Adobe Acrobat couldn't recognize it as a valid PDF file.

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed `render-order-pdf-background.cjs`

Replaced the base64 data URL generation with proper Cloudinary upload. The PDF is now:
1. Generated as a buffer
2. Uploaded to Cloudinary's 'final_pdfs' folder
3. Cloudinary URL stored in database
4. URL used for downloads

## PDF Specifications

All generated PDFs meet print-ready requirements:

- **Resolution**: 100 DPI (optimized for file size while maintaining quality)
- **Bleed**: 0.125 inches (1/8") on all sides
- **Format**: PDF with embedded JPEG (quality 85)
- **Dimensions**: Exact banner size + bleed
- **Layers**: All text and images properly composited

## Deployment

Changes have been:
- ✅ Committed to git
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub (main branch)
- ⏳ Netlify will auto-deploy

## Testing

Test the fix by:
1. Going to admin panel
2. Finding an order with banners
3. Clicking download PDF
4. Verifying it opens in Adobe Acrobat without errors
5. Checking that all text and images are present
