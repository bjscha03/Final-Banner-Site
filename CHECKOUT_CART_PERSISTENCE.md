# Checkout Cart Persistence Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of seamless cart persistence and checkout flow when guest users authenticate during checkout. The system ensures that users never lose their cart items or checkout context when creating an account or signing in.

## Problem Statement

**Before Implementation:**
- Guest users who proceeded to checkout and then created an account or signed in would lose their cart items
- Users were redirected to the homepage or design page instead of back to checkout
- No mechanism to preserve guest cart session across authentication

**After Implementation:**
- Guest cart is automatically merged with user account cart upon authentication
- Users are redirected back to checkout after successful sign-in/sign-up
- Checkout context is preserved across authentication flows
- Guest session ID is tracked to ensure correct cart merging

## Key Features

### 1. Checkout Context Persistence
- Stores return URL and guest session ID
- 30-minute expiration for security
- Survives page refreshes via localStorage

### 2. Cart Merging Strategy
- Deep matching by product attributes
- Quantity summing for matching items
- Unique items added as separate line items
- Authoritative pricing preserved

### 3. Edge Case Handling
- Multiple browser tabs/sessions
- Authentication failures
- Session expiration
- Existing user carts

## Implementation Files

### New Files
- `src/store/checkoutContext.ts` - Checkout context Zustand store

### Modified Files
- `src/components/checkout/SignUpEncouragementModal.tsx` - Preserve context before redirect
- `src/pages/SignIn.tsx` - Handle checkout redirect after sign-in
- `src/pages/SignUp.tsx` - Handle checkout redirect after sign-up
- `src/hooks/useCartSync.ts` - Use checkout context session ID
- `src/lib/cartSync.ts` - Accept explicit session ID parameter

## Testing

Test the complete flow:
1. Add items to cart as guest
2. Go to checkout
3. Click "Create Account" or "Sign In"
4. Complete authentication
5. Verify redirect to checkout
6. Verify cart items are intact

## Security

- 30-minute context expiration
- Session validation before merging
- Database constraints prevent duplicates
- Guest carts archived (not deleted) for audit trail
