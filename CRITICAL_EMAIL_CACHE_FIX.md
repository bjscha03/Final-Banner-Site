# CRITICAL: Email Template Cache Issue - Resolution

**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Issue:** Email fixes not appearing in production despite code changes
**Root Cause:** Netlify serverless function caching
**Status:** ✅ Cache-busting deployment in progress

---

## What Happened

### Timeline
1. **Oct 9, 9:57 PM** - Committed email fixes (commit 50cf499):
   - Added `timeZone: 'America/New_York'` to all email templates
   - Reduced spacing in OrderShipped.tsx (logo: 5px→0px, header: 40px→20px)

2. **Oct 10, 2:04 AM** - User received shipping email with:
   - ❌ **Still showing incorrect time** (2:04 AM instead of correct Eastern Time)
   - ❌ **Still showing excessive white space** between logo and header

3. **Oct 10, 2:30 AM** - Investigation revealed:
   - ✅ Code changes ARE in the repository
   - ✅ Code changes ARE pushed to GitHub
   - ❌ **Netlify is serving CACHED versions of the email templates**

### Root Cause: Netlify Function Caching

**The Problem:**
- Email templates are imported by Netlify serverless functions
- Netlify uses **Node File Trace (nft)** bundler for functions
- When you push code changes, Netlify may **reuse cached function bundles** if it thinks nothing changed
- Even though `src/emails/**` is in `included_files`, Netlify's cache wasn't invalidated

**Why This Happened:**
- The email template files changed, but the **function files themselves didn't change**
- Netlify's build system saw no changes to `netlify/functions/*.cjs` files
- It reused the cached function bundles which contained the **old email templates**
- Result: New code in repo, but old templates in production

---

## The Fix

### What I Did (Commit 1065191)

1. **Added `.netlify-rebuild-trigger` file**
   - Forces Netlify to see a "change" in the repository
   - Triggers a complete rebuild of all functions
   - Clears the function bundle cache

2. **Added cache-busting comment to `OrderShipped.tsx`**
   - Modifies the email template file itself
   - Ensures Netlify sees the file as "changed"
   - Forces re-bundling of the template

3. **Pushed to production**
   - Commit: `1065191`
   - This will trigger a fresh Netlify deployment
   - All functions will be rebuilt from scratch
   - Email templates will be re-bundled with the correct code

---

## What You Need To Do

### 1. Wait for Netlify Deployment (5-10 minutes)

Check your Netlify dashboard:
- Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/bannersonthefly/deploys
- Look for the deployment triggered by commit `1065191`
- Wait for it to show **"Published"** status

### 2. Clear Any Local Caches

If you're testing locally:
```bash
cd /Users/brandonschaefer/Projects/Final-Banner-Site
rm -rf .netlify
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm run build
```

### 3. Send a Test Email

After Netlify deployment completes:

**Option A: Place a test order**
- Go to https://bannersonthefly.com
- Create a test banner
- Complete checkout
- Mark it as shipped in admin panel
- Check the shipping notification email

**Option B: Use the email test function**
- If you have an email testing endpoint, use it
- Or manually trigger a shipping notification from the admin panel

### 4. Verify the Fixes

Check the test email for:

✅ **Date/Time Fix:**
- Email should show current Eastern Time
- No 3+ hour offset
- Example: If sent at 2:30 AM Eastern, should show "October 10, 2025 at 2:30 AM" (not 6:30 AM)

✅ **Spacing Fix:**
- Logo to header gap should be **noticeably smaller**
- Should look compact and professional
- Compare to your screenshot - the white space should be reduced by ~25px

---

## Technical Details

### Netlify Configuration
```toml
[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "nft"
  included_files = ["src/lib/**", "src/emails/**"]
```

### The Caching Problem
- `included_files` tells Netlify to include these files in function bundles
- But if the **function file itself** doesn't change, Netlify may reuse the cached bundle
- The cached bundle contains the **old versions** of the included files

### The Solution
- Modify a file that Netlify tracks for changes (`.netlify-rebuild-trigger`)
- Modify the email template itself (added comment)
- This forces Netlify to:
  1. Invalidate the function bundle cache
  2. Re-bundle all functions
  3. Include the **new versions** of email templates

---

## Verification Commands

After deployment, you can verify the code is correct:

```bash
# Check timezone is present
grep "timeZone: 'America/New_York'" src/emails/OrderShipped.tsx

# Check spacing is reduced
grep "padding: '10px 30px 0px'" src/emails/OrderShipped.tsx  # Logo (0px bottom)
grep "padding: '20px 30px'" src/emails/OrderShipped.tsx      # Header (20px top)

# Check cache-busting comment is present
grep "CACHE BUST" src/emails/OrderShipped.tsx
```

---

## If The Problem Persists

If you send a test email after deployment and the fixes STILL don't appear:

### Option 1: Manual Netlify Cache Clear
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Site settings → Build & deploy → Post processing
3. Click "Clear cache and retry deploy"
4. Wait for rebuild to complete

### Option 2: Force Complete Rebuild
```bash
# Make a trivial change to a function file
echo "// Cache bust $(date)" >> netlify/functions/email-monitoring.cjs
git add netlify/functions/email-monitoring.cjs
git commit -m "Force function rebuild"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Check Netlify Build Logs
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/bannersonthefly/deploys
2. Click on the latest deploy
3. Check the build logs for:
   - "Building functions..."
   - Look for `src/emails/OrderShipped.tsx` being included
   - Verify no errors during function bundling

---

## Prevention For Future

To avoid this issue in the future:

### 1. Always Modify Function Files When Changing Templates
When you update email templates, also make a trivial change to a function file:
```bash
# Add a comment with timestamp
echo "// Updated: $(date)" >> netlify/functions/email-monitoring.cjs
```

### 2. Use Environment Variables for Cache Busting
Add to `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build.environment]
  EMAIL_TEMPLATE_VERSION = "2025-10-10"
```
Update this version whenever you change email templates.

### 3. Monitor Netlify Deployments
- Always check Netlify dashboard after pushing changes
- Verify "Building functions" appears in logs
- Check for "Cached" vs "Built" status for functions

## Summary

**What Was Wrong:**
- ✅ Code changes were correct
- ✅ Code was committed and pushed
- ❌ Netlify was serving cached function bundles with old email templates

**What I Fixed:**
- ✅ Added cache-busting trigger file
- ✅ Modified email template to force rebuild
- ✅ Pushed changes to trigger fresh deployment

**What You Need To Do:**
1. ⏳ Wait for Netlify deployment to complete (5-10 min)
2. 🧪 Send a test shipping email
3. ✅ Verify date/time is correct (Eastern Time, no offset)
4. ✅ Verify spacing is reduced (compact layout)

**Expected Result:**
After the deployment completes, all new emails sent will have:
- ✅ Correct Eastern Time timestamps
- ✅ Reduced white space (25px less)
- ✅ Professional, compact layout
