# Cart Thumbnail and Grommet Dropdown Fixes

## Date: 2025-10-12

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cart Thumbnail Images Missing
**Problem:** Cart items were not displaying thumbnail preview images of uploaded/designed banners.

**Solution:** Added thumbnail display to CartModal component with:
- Image thumbnails for uploaded files (`item.file_url`)
- Image thumbnails for AI-generated designs (`item.aiDesign?.assets?.proofUrl`)
- Fallback placeholder showing banner dimensions when no image is available
- Responsive sizing: 80x80px on mobile, 96x96px on desktop
- Error handling with automatic fallback to placeholder
- Proper spacing and layout integration

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/CartModal.tsx`

### 2. Grommet Dropdown Not Working in Mobile Landscape
**Problem:** The grommet dropdown/select element was not functioning properly on mobile devices in horizontal/landscape orientation due to touch-action conflicts with the Design page.

**Root Cause:** The Design page has `touchAction: 'pan-y pinch-zoom'` which was preventing proper interaction with the dropdown portal elements.

**Solution:** Added explicit `touchAction` styles to GrommetPicker component:
- Mobile sheet container: `touchAction: 'none'` to override parent
- Backdrop: `touchAction: 'auto'` to allow clicks
- Bottom sheet: `touchAction: 'auto'` to allow scrolling and interaction
- Desktop dropdown: `touchAction: 'auto'` to ensure proper interaction

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/ui/GrommetPicker.tsx`
