# AI Credits Purchase Flow Fixes

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Commit:** 4a96b11  
**Components:** 
- `netlify/functions/notify-credit-purchase.cjs`
- `src/components/ai/PurchaseCreditsModal.tsx`

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Logo Not Displaying in Token Purchase Emails

**Problem:**
The logo was not showing up in the token purchase confirmation emails sent to users after they purchased AI credits. This affected the professional appearance of the confirmation emails.

**Root Cause:**
The email template was using a Cloudinary fetch URL with `f_auto` format parameter, which was trying to fetch an SVG file. Many email clients (especially Outlook and Gmail) block or don't properly render SVG images for security reasons.

**Original URL:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dtrxl120u/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,w_300/https://bannersonthefly.com/cld-assets/images/logo-compact.svg
```

**Solution:**
Updated the email template to use Cloudinary fetch with PNG conversion (`f_png`). This automatically converts the SVG logo to PNG format, which is universally supported across all email clients.

**New URL:**
```
https://res.cloudinary.com/dtrxl120u/image/fetch/f_png,w_400,q_auto/https://bannersonthefly.com/images/logo-compact.svg
```

**Changes:**
- Changed format from `f_auto` to `f_png` for guaranteed PNG output
- Updated source path from `/cld-assets/images/` to `/images/`
- Increased width from 300px to 400px for better quality (still displays at max 200px in email)
- Cloudinary automatically converts SVG to PNG on-the-fly and caches it

**Email Client Compatibility:**
✅ Gmail (web, iOS, Android)  
✅ Outlook (desktop, web, mobile)  
✅ Apple Mail (macOS, iOS)  
✅ Yahoo Mail  
✅ ProtonMail  
✅ Thunderbird

### Issue 2: Unnecessary Spinner After "Select a Package" Click

**Problem:**
After a user clicked the "Select a Package" button to purchase AI credits, a "Processing your purchase..." spinner appeared and spun continuously throughout the entire process, even while the user was interacting with PayPal buttons. This created a poor UX as the spinner suggested the system was busy when it was actually waiting for user input.

**Root Cause:**
In the `handlePurchase` function, `setIsProcessing(true)` was called when the package was selected (line 179), but it was never set back to `false` after the PayPal buttons were rendered. The spinner would only stop after:
- Payment was completed successfully
- Payment was cancelled
- An error occurred

This meant the spinner was visible during the entire PayPal interaction, which could take minutes if the user was reviewing payment details.

**Solution:**
Added `setIsProcessing(false)` immediately after the PayPal buttons are rendered. This ensures the spinner only shows during the brief period when:
1. Creating the PayPal order (API call)
2. Initializing PayPal buttons (SDK setup)

Once the PayPal buttons are ready for user interaction, the spinner is hidden.

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Before (spinner never stopped)
}).render('#paypal-button-container');
        }
      }

// After (spinner stops when buttons are ready)
}).render('#paypal-button-container');

// Hide spinner once PayPal buttons are rendered
setIsProcessing(false);
        }
      }
```

**Spinner Behavior Timeline:**

| Step | Before Fix | After Fix |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| User clicks "Select a Package" | ⏳ Spinner shows | ⏳ Spinner shows |
| Creating PayPal order (API call) | ⏳ Spinner shows | ⏳ Spinner shows |
| Rendering PayPal buttons | ⏳ Spinner shows | ⏳ Spinner shows |
| PayPal buttons ready | ⏳ **Spinner still showing** ❌ | ✅ **Spinner hidden** ✅ |
| User reviews payment | ⏳ **Spinner still showing** ❌ | ✅ No spinner |
| User clicks PayPal button | ⏳ **Spinner still showing** ❌ | ✅ No spinner |
| User completes payment | ⏳ Spinner shows | ⏳ Spinner shows (brief) |
| Payment captured | ✅ Spinner hidden | ✅ Spinner hidden |

4. Check email client's image blocking settings
5. Verify email is not in spam folder (images often blocked in spam)

## Technical Details

### Email Template Structure

The email uses inline CSS for maximum compatibility:

```html
<div class="logo-container">
  <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtrxl120u/image/fetch/f_png,w_400,q_auto/https://bannersonthefly.com/images/logo-compact.svg" 
       alt="Banners On The Fly Logo" 
       style="max-width: 200px; width: 100%; height: auto; display: inline-block;">
</div>
```

**Inline Styles:**
- `max-width: 200px` - Limits logo size
- `width: 100%` - Responsive on mobile
- `height: auto` - Maintains aspect ratio
- `display: inline-block` - Prevents layout issues

**Container Styles:**
```css
.logo-container {
  background: #ffffff;
  padding: 20px;
  text-align: center;
  border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
}
```

**Dark Mode Safety:**
```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .logo-container {
    background: #ffffff !important;
  }
}
```

This ensures the logo always has a white background, even in dark mode email clients.

### Spinner State Management

The `isProcessing` state controls the spinner visibility:

**State Flow:**
```typescript
// Initial state
const [isProcessing, setIsProcessing] = useState(false);

// User clicks "Select a Package"
setIsProcessing(true);  // Show spinner

// Create PayPal order (async)
const { orderID } = await createResponse.json();

// Render PayPal buttons
window.paypal.Buttons({...}).render('#paypal-button-container');

// Hide spinner immediately after render
setIsProcessing(false);  // ✅ NEW: Hide spinner

// User interacts with PayPal (no spinner)
// ...

// Payment captured
setIsProcessing(false);  // Already false, but reset for safety
```

**Error Handling:**
All error paths reset `isProcessing`:
- `onError`: `setIsProcessing(false)`
- `onCancel`: `setIsProcessing(false)`
- `catch` block: `setIsProcessing(false)`

## Future Improvements

### Email Logo
1. **Consider using base64 encoded image** for guaranteed delivery
   - Pros: Always displays, no external requests
   - Cons: Increases email size, some clients block base64

2. **Add fallback text** if image doesn't load
   - Use `alt` text styling for better appearance

3. **A/B test different logo sizes** for optimal appearance

### Spinner UX
1. **Add progress indicators** for different stages
   - "Creating order..."
   - "Loading payment options..."
   - "Processing payment..."

2. **Show PayPal logo** while buttons are loading
   - Provides visual feedback
   - Sets user expectations

3. **Add skeleton loader** instead of spinner
   - More modern UX
   - Shows where PayPal buttons will appear
