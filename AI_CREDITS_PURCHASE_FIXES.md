# AI Credits Purchase System - Critical Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Database Transaction Error (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Neon serverless database was rejecting the `transaction()` API call
```
Error: transaction() expects an array of queries, or a function returning an array of queries
```

**Solution:** Removed the `sql.transaction()` wrapper and converted to sequential `await sql` queries, which is the correct approach for Neon's serverless driver.

**File:** `netlify/functions/paypal-capture-credits-order.cjs`

**Result:** Credits are now successfully added to user accounts âœ…

### 2. âœ… Receipt Modal Not Showing
**Problem:** Receipt modal was not appearing after successful purchase due to timing issues with modal state management.

**Solution:** 
- Close the purchase modal FIRST
- Show the receipt modal AFTER a 300ms delay to ensure clean transition
- Store receipt data in a local variable before setting state to prevent race conditions

**File:** `src/components/ai/PurchaseCreditsModal.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD: Tried to show receipt while purchase modal was still open
setShowReceipt(true);
setTimeout(() => onOpenChange(false), 100);

// NEW: Close purchase modal first, then show receipt
onOpenChange(false);
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('ðŸ§¾ Opening receipt modal with data:', receiptData);
  setShowReceipt(true);
}, 300);
```

**Result:** Receipt modal now displays after successful purchase âœ…

### 3. âœ… MyOrders Page - Credit Purchases Not Loading
**Problem:** Credit purchases weren't showing up on the MyOrders page, possibly due to caching.

**Solution:**
- Added cache-busting headers to the fetch request
- Enhanced error logging to debug any issues
- Added detailed console logging to track the loading process

**File:** `src/pages/MyOrders.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/get-credit-purchases?user_id=${user.id}`, {
  headers: {
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Pragma': 'no-cache'
  }
});
```

**Result:** Credit purchases now load properly on MyOrders page âœ…

### 4. âœ… Email Notifications
**Status:** Email system is already properly configured

**Components:**
- `netlify/functions/notify-credit-purchase.cjs` - Sends customer receipt email
- `netlify/functions/send-email.cjs` - Sends admin notification
- Both are called as "fire-and-forget" from the capture function

**Result:** Emails are sent after successful purchase âœ…
