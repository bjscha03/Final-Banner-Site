### Interactive Image Manipulation Features

#### 1. **Resize Functionality** ✅
**Feature**: Click/drag corner handles to scale image proportionally  
**Implementation**:
- Visible resize handles at all 4 corners (NW, NE, SW, SE)
- Blue circles with white fill and glow effect
- Responsive sizing (3% of banner dimension, min 0.6 SVG units)
- Cursor changes to directional resize cursors
- Scale constraints: 20% minimum, 300% maximum
- Aspect ratio always maintained

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Resize sensitivity: 0.004 multiplier
const newScale = Math.max(0.2, Math.min(3, initialImageScale + scaleChange));
```

#### 2. **Drag/Move Functionality** ✅
**Feature**: Click/drag image to reposition within preview area  
**Implementation**:
- Smooth movement with mouse/touch
- Dynamic boundary constraints (±40% of max dimension)
- Cursor changes: grab (idle) → grabbing (dragging)
- Improved drag sensitivity (1.5x multiplier)

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Drag sensitivity: 1.5x multiplier
const sensitivity = 1.5;
const maxMove = Math.max(widthIn, heightIn) * 0.4;
const newX = Math.max(-maxMove, Math.min(maxMove, initialImagePosition.x + (deltaX * sensitivity)));
```

#### 3. **Touch and Mouse Support** ✅
**Feature**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices  
**Implementation**:
- Mouse events: mousedown, mousemove, mouseup
- Touch events: touchstart, touchmove, touchend
- Global event listeners for smooth dragging
- Passive: false for touch events to prevent scrolling

#### 4. **State Management** ✅
**Feature**: Position and scale persist across views  
**Implementation**:
- Image position (x, y) stored in quote store
- Image scale (multiplier) stored in quote store
- Local state syncs with store on mount
- Changes persist automatically via useEffect
- State resets when new file uploaded

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Sync with store on mount
React.useEffect(() => {
  const storeState = useQuoteStore.getState();
  if (storeState.imagePosition) {
    setImagePosition(storeState.imagePosition);
  }
  if (storeState.imageScale !== undefined) {
    setImageScale(storeState.imageScale);
  }
}, []);

// Persist changes to store
React.useEffect(() => {
  set({ imagePosition, imageScale });
}, [imagePosition, imageScale, set]);
```

#### 5. **Visual Design** ✅
**Feature**: Professional, intuitive interface  
**Implementation**:
- Resize handles: White circles with blue border (#3b82f6)
- Blue glow effect (20% opacity) for visibility
- Inner blue dot for better contrast
- Handles hidden during drag operation
- Smooth cursor transitions

---

## 🎨 Visual Design Details

### Resize Handles

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Variables (Local)
```typescript
const [imagePosition, setImagePosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
const [imageScale, setImageScale] = useState(1);
const [isDraggingImage, setIsDraggingImage] = useState(false);
const [isResizingImage, setIsResizingImage] = useState(false);
const [resizeHandle, setResizeHandle] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [dragStart, setDragStart] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
const [initialImagePosition, setInitialImagePosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
const [initialImageScale, setInitialImageScale] = useState(1);
```

### Event Flow

#### Drag Operation
1. User clicks/taps on image → `handleImageMouseDown` / `handleImageTouchStart`
2. Set `isDraggingImage = true`, capture start position
3. Global `mousemove` / `touchmove` listener calculates delta
4. Update `imagePosition` with sensitivity multiplier and boundary constraints
5. User releases → `mouseup` / `touchend` sets `isDraggingImage = false`

#### Resize Operation
1. User clicks/taps on resize handle → `handleImageMouseDown` detects handle
2. Set `isResizingImage = true`, capture handle ID and start position
3. Global `mousemove` listener calculates scale change based on handle direction
4. Update `imageScale` with min/max constraints (0.2 to 3.0)
5. User releases → `mouseup` sets `isResizingImage = false`

### Coordinate System
- **Image Position:** Offset in banner coordinate system (inches)
- **Conversion:** Multiply by 0.01 to convert to SVG units
- **Boundaries:** Dynamic based on banner dimensions (±40% of max dimension)
- **Scale:** Multiplier (1.0 = 100%, 0.2 = 20%, 3.0 = 300%)
