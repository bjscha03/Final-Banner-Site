  - generateAutoSummary() - Auto-summary generation (80-150 words)

### Build & Deployment

- ✅ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Netlify auto-deployment triggered

## ⚠️ MISSING - CRITICAL

### Netlify Functions (API Endpoints)
The following Netlify Functions need to be created for the frontend to work:

1. **events-list.cjs** - GET /api/events
   - List events with filters (status, category, city, state, featured)
   - Pagination support
   - Calendar/list format toggle

2. **events-get.cjs** - GET /api/events/:slug
   - Get single event by slug
   - Include 4 related events (same category, upcoming)

3. **events-submit.cjs** - POST /api/events/submit
   - Public event submission
   - Auto-generate slug and summary
   - Set status to 'pending'

4. **events-categories.cjs** - GET /api/events/categories
   - Get all categories with event counts

5. **admin-events.cjs** - GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/events
   - List events with admin filters
   - Update event status (approve/reject)
   - Toggle featured flag
   - Delete events

6. **admin-events-ingest.cjs** - POST /api/admin/events/ingest
   - Bulk import events from JSON
   - Dry-run mode
   - Upsert mode (update existing by slug)

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Required for functionality)
1. Create the 6 Netlify Functions listed above
2. Test each API endpoint
3. Verify frontend pages can fetch data

### Post-Launch
1. Integrate real admin authentication (currently uses placeholder)
2. Add events to sitemap for SEO
3. Bulk import initial events via admin panel
4. Monitor performance in Netlify Analytics
5. Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

Once Netlify Functions are deployed:

- [ ] Visit /events - should load (may be empty initially)
- [ ] Submit test event via /events/submit
- [ ] Check /admin/events - should see pending event
- [ ] Approve event in admin panel
- [ ] Visit /events/:slug - should show event detail
- [ ] Test bulk ingest with sample JSON
- [ ] Verify Cloudinary images load
- [ ] Run Lighthouse performance audit

- Full deployment guide: EVENTS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (needs to be created)
- Database schema: database-migrations/001-events-system.sql
- Helper functions: netlify/functions/utils/eventHelpers.cjs

---

**Status**: Frontend complete, database ready, API endpoints needed
**Priority**: Create Netlify Functions ASAP to make the system functional
