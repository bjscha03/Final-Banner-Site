# Email Verification Flow Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Missing Logo in Verification Email**

**Problem**: The logo wasn't appearing in verification emails due to environment variable issues during server-side rendering.

**Solution**: 
- Updated all email templates to use absolute URLs instead of environment variables
- Changed from: `${process.env.PUBLIC_SITE_URL || 'https://www.bannersonthefly.com'}/images/logo-compact.svg`
- Changed to: `'https://www.bannersonthefly.com/images/logo-compact.svg'`

**Files Updated**:
- `src/emails/VerifyEmail.tsx`
- `src/emails/OrderConfirmation.tsx`
- `src/emails/ContactReceived.tsx`
- `src/emails/OrderShipped.tsx`
- `src/emails/AdminOrderNotification.tsx`
- `src/emails/ContactAcknowledgment.tsx`
- `src/emails/OrderCanceled.tsx`
- `src/emails/ResetPassword.tsx`

### 2. ✅ **Broken Email Verification Flow**

**Problem**: Users were automatically signed in after signup, bypassing email verification entirely.

**Solution**: 
- Modified signup flow to create account without auto-signing in
- Added redirect to "Check Your Email" page after successful signup
- Users must verify email before they can sign in

**Files Updated**:
- `src/pages/SignUp.tsx` - Updated signup logic to not auto-sign in
- `src/pages/SignIn.tsx` - Added email verification check

### 3. ✅ **Dashboard 404 Error**

**Problem**: "Go to Dashboard" button in email verification success page linked to `/dashboard` which doesn't exist.

**Solution**: 
- Changed button to link to `/my-orders` instead
- Updated button text to "Go to My Orders"

**Files Updated**:
- `src/pages/VerifyEmail.tsx`

### 4. ✅ **Missing "Check Your Email" Page**

**Problem**: No intermediate page to inform users to check their email after signup.

**Solution**: 
- Created new `CheckEmail.tsx` component
- Added route to router configuration
- Displays email verification instructions and resend option

**Files Created**:
- `src/pages/CheckEmail.tsx`

**Files Updated**:
- `src/App.tsx` - Added route for `/check-email`

## Logo Display in Emails

- Environment variable not available during email rendering
