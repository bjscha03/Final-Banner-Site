# 🔍 Debugging Preview Reset Issue

## Current Status

The preview image is not clearing after adding items to cart, despite calling `resetDesign()`.

## Debugging Added (Commit: 1f3d2fe)

I've added comprehensive console logging to trace exactly what's happening:

### 1. AddToCartButton Logging

When you click "Add to Cart", you'll now see:
```
🔄 RESET: About to call resetDesign() after add
🔄 RESET: Current file before reset: {url: "...", name: "..."}
🔄 RESET: resetDesign() called
🔄 RESET: Current file after reset: undefined (or the file object)
```

### 2. Quote Store Logging

When `resetDesign()` is called:
```
🔄 QUOTE STORE: resetDesign() called
🔄 QUOTE STORE: Setting file to undefined
```

### 3. LivePreviewCard useEffect Logging

When the file changes:
```
🔄 PREVIEW USEEFFECT: File changed, file is now: undefined (or file object)
🔄 PREVIEW USEEFFECT: File is undefined, resetting image state
🔄 PREVIEW USEEFFECT: Image state reset complete
```

OR if file still exists:
```
🔄 PREVIEW USEEFFECT: File exists, not resetting
```

## How to Test

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify deployment
2. Open the site and open browser console (F12)
3. Upload an image to the design area
4. Click "Add to Cart"
5. **Watch the console logs** - they will show exactly what's happening

## What to Look For

### Scenario A: resetDesign() is NOT being called
If you don't see the "🔄 RESET" logs, then the button click handler isn't working.

### Scenario B: resetDesign() IS called but file doesn't change
If you see:
```
🔄 RESET: Current file before reset: {url: "..."}
🔄 RESET: Current file after reset: {url: "..."}  ← SAME FILE!
```
Then Zustand isn't updating the state properly.

### Scenario C: File changes but useEffect doesn't run
If you see the RESET logs but NOT the PREVIEW USEEFFECT logs, then React isn't detecting the change.

### Scenario D: useEffect runs but says "File exists"
If you see:
```
🔄 PREVIEW USEEFFECT: File exists, not resetting
```
Then the file is not actually undefined.

## Next Steps

**Please test and send me the console logs** showing what happens when you:
1. Add an item to cart
2. What logs appear in the console

This will tell us exactly where the issue is occurring.

## Also Included: Netlify Functions for Cart Sync

I've created three Netlify Functions to fix the database authentication issue:

- `cart-load.cjs` - Load cart from Neon database
- `cart-save.cjs` - Save cart to Neon database  
- `cart-clear.cjs` - Clear cart from Neon database

These will be used in the next step to implement secure cart synchronization, but first we need to fix the preview reset issue.
