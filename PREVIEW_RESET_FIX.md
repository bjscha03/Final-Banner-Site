# ✅ Preview Area Reset Fix

## Issue Fixed
The preview area was not clearing the displayed image after adding items to cart, even though the design data was being reset.

## Root Cause
The `LivePreviewCard` component maintains local state for `imagePosition` and `imageScale` that wasn't being reset when `file` was set to `undefined` by the `resetDesign()` function.

## Solution
Added a `useEffect` hook that watches the `file` prop and resets all image-related states when the file is cleared:

```typescript
// Reset image position and scale when file is cleared
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (!file) {
    setImagePosition({ x: 0, y: 0 });
    setImageScale(1);
    setIsImageSelected(false);
    setIsDraggingImage(false);
    setIsResizingImage(false);
    setResizeHandle(null);
  }
}, [file]);
```

## What Gets Reset
- ✅ Image position → (0, 0)
- ✅ Image scale → 1
- ✅ Image selection state → false
- ✅ Image dragging state → false
- ✅ Image resizing state → false
- ✅ Resize handle → null

## Testing
After deployment:
1. Upload an image to the design area
2. Position/scale the image
3. Click "Add to Cart"
4. ✅ Toast appears: "Added to Cart"
5. ✅ Preview area clears completely
6. ✅ All design fields reset to defaults

## Deployment
- **Commit:** `2c5d141`
- **Status:** ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- **Netlify:** Auto-deploying (2-3 minutes)

## ⚠️ Separate Issue: Cart Sync Database Errors

You're also seeing these errors in the console:

```
❌ CART SYNC ERROR: password authentication failed for user 'neondb_owner'
```

**This is a separate issue** related to the Neon database connection. The cart is still working (items are being added), but they're only stored in localStorage, not syncing to the Neon database.

### Possible Causes:
1. **Database credentials changed** - The Neon database password may have been rotated
2. **Environment variable not set** - `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` or `VITE_DATABASE_URL` may not be configured in Netlify
3. **Database connection string format** - The connection string may be incorrect

### To Fix:
1. Go to your Neon dashboard
2. Get the latest connection string
3. Update the environment variable in Netlify:
   - Go to Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables
   - Update `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` with the new connection string
4. Redeploy the site

**Note:** The cart will continue to work locally (using localStorage) even if the database sync fails. This is by design for resilience.
