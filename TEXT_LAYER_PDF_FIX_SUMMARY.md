# Text Layer PDF Rendering - Implementation Summary

## Problem
When users added text to their banner designs using the text tool, the text layers were NOT being rendered in the downloaded PDF.

## Solution
Implemented complete text layer support in PDF generation:

### 1. Database Migration
Run: `psql $NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL < database-add-text-elements.sql`

### 2. Code Changes (Commits d1a2f8f, d8f2b3b)
- Cart store: Captures textElements when adding to cart
- Order creation: Saves text_elements to database
- PDF download: Sends text_elements in request
- PDF generation: Renders text layers with PDFKit

### 3. Features
✅ Proper positioning (percentage-based)
✅ Font support (Helvetica, Times, Courier)
✅ Font weight (normal, bold)
✅ Colors and alignment
✅ 150 DPI print quality
✅ Backward compatible

## Testing
1. Run database migration
2. Create order with text layers
3. Download PDF from admin
4. Verify text appears correctly in Adobe Acrobat
