## üìä Expected Impact

Based on Google Ads best practices research:

### Before (Video Popup)
- Video asset: 2MB
- Hardcoded code: WELCOME20
- No email capture
- No exit-intent recovery

### After (Email-Capture)
- No video: Instant load
- Unique codes per email
- Email list building
- Exit-intent recovery: +5-10% captures
- **Email capture rate: 10-15%** (industry average)
- **Code usage rate: 30-40%** (of captured emails)

### ROI Potential
If you get 1,000 homepage visitors/month:
- Email captures: 100-150 emails
- Code usage: 30-60 orders
- At $100 average order: **$3,000-6,000 in revenue**
- Plus: 100-150 emails for future marketing
