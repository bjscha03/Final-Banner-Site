# Drag Sensitivity and Resize Handle Size Fix

## üêõ Issues Reported

### Issue 1: Drag Sensitivity Too High
**Problem**: Image dragging works (no disappearing), but the drag speed/sensitivity is too high. The image moves much faster than cursor movement, making precise positioning difficult.

**User Feedback**: "When I drag the image, it moves much faster than my cursor movement, making it difficult to position precisely."

### Issue 2: Resize Handles Look Like Grommets
**Problem**: The resize handles (blue circles at corners) are too large and could be confused with grommets (the actual holes in the banner).

**User Feedback**: "The drag points on each corner look huge like circles and could be confused with grommets."

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Reduced Drag Sensitivity

**Changed**: Drag sensitivity from **100** to **30** (70% reduction)

**Files Modified**: `src/components/design/LivePreviewCard.tsx`

**Mouse Drag Handler** (line 715):
```typescript
// BEFORE
const sensitivity = 100; // 1:1 pixel movement (100 storage units = 1 SVG unit)

// AFTER
const sensitivity = 30; // Reduced from 100 for slower, more precise dragging
```

**Touch Drag Handler** (line 769):
```typescript
// BEFORE
const sensitivity = 100;

// AFTER
const sensitivity = 30; // Reduced from 100 for slower, more precise dragging
```

**Impact**:
- Dragging is now **70% slower**
- More precise control for fine-grained positioning
- Cursor and image movement feel more natural
- Easier to position image exactly where you want it

**Note**: Resize sensitivity (0.0015) was **NOT changed** - resizing speed is fine.

### Fix 2: Reduced Resize Handle Size

**Changed**: Handle size calculation from **0.6 max / 3% of banner** to **0.25 max / 1.5% of banner**

**Files Modified**: `src/components/design/PreviewCanvas.tsx`

**Handle Size Calculation** (line 269):
```typescript
// BEFORE
const handleSize = Math.min(0.6, Math.max(widthIn, heightIn) * 0.03);

// AFTER
const handleSize = Math.min(0.25, Math.max(widthIn, heightIn) * 0.015);
// Smaller handles to avoid confusion with grommets
```

**Impact**:
- Handles are now **~58% smaller** (0.25 vs 0.6 max)
- Calculation uses **1.5%** of banner size instead of **3%**
- Handles are clearly distinguishable from grommets
- Still large enough to be easily clickable
- Professional appearance

**Visual Comparison**:
- **Before**: Large blue circles that look like grommets
- **After**: Smaller, more subtle resize handles

## üìä Technical Details

### Drag Sensitivity Calculation

The sensitivity value controls how many storage units are added per pixel of cursor movement:

```typescript
const newX = initialImagePosition.x + (deltaX * sensitivity);
```

**Before (sensitivity = 100)**:
- User drags 10 pixels ‚Üí deltaX = 10
- Position change: 10 * 100 = 1000 storage units
- Rendered change: 1000 * 0.01 = 10 SVG units
- **Result**: 1:1 movement (but felt too fast)

**After (sensitivity = 30)**:
- User drags 10 pixels ‚Üí deltaX = 10
- Position change: 10 * 30 = 300 storage units
- Rendered change: 300 * 0.01 = 3 SVG units
- **Result**: 3:10 movement (30% of cursor speed - much more controllable)

### Handle Size Calculation

The handle size is calculated based on the banner dimensions:

```typescript
const handleSize = Math.min(maxSize, Math.max(widthIn, heightIn) * percentage);
```

**Example for 24" x 36" banner**:

**Before**:
- `Math.min(0.6, 36 * 0.03) = Math.min(0.6, 1.08) = 0.6`
- Handle radius: **0.6 inches** (1.2" diameter)
- **Very large** - looks like a grommet!

**After**:
- `Math.min(0.25, 36 * 0.015) = Math.min(0.25, 0.54) = 0.25`
- Handle radius: **0.25 inches** (0.5" diameter)
- **Much smaller** - clearly a UI control, not a grommet

## üß™ Testing

### Build Status
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ‚úÖ Vite build: Successful
- ‚úÖ Bundle size: 1,695.25 kB (no change)

### Manual Testing Required

After deployment:

#### Drag Sensitivity
- [ ] Drag image - **moves slower than before**
- [ ] Drag 10 pixels - **image moves ~3 pixels** (30% of cursor movement)
- [ ] Fine positioning - **much easier and more precise**
- [ ] Feels natural - **not too fast, not too slow**
- [ ] Touch drag - **same slower speed on mobile**

#### Resize Handle Size
- [ ] Handles visible - **smaller but still easy to see**
- [ ] Handles clickable - **still easy to grab**
- [ ] Not confused with grommets - **clearly different**
- [ ] Professional appearance - **subtle and clean**
- [ ] All 4 corners - **consistent size**

#### Existing Functionality (Should Still Work)
- [ ] Image dragging - **works correctly**
- [ ] Image resizing - **works correctly** (speed unchanged)
- [ ] Handle visibility - **appears/disappears correctly**
- [ ] Coordinate system - **no disappearing** (previous fix intact)
