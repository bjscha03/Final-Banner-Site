# Interactive Image Editor Implementation - Manual Test Guide

## Features Implemented:

### 1. VistaPrint-Style Interactive Image Editing ✅
- **Click-to-select functionality**: Click on any uploaded image to select it
- **Visual selection indicator**: Selected images show a blue ring/border
- **Interactive toolbar**: Appears when image is selected with intuitive controls

### 2. Image Manipulation Controls ✅
- **Zoom In/Out**: Scale the image up or down (10% increments, 10%-300% range)
- **Rotate**: Rotate image in 90-degree increments
- **Drag/Move**: Click and drag to reposition the image within the canvas
- **Reset**: Return image to original position, scale, and rotation

### 3. Real-time Feedback ✅
- **Transform display**: Shows current scale percentage and rotation in info panel
- **Smooth transitions**: CSS transitions for better user experience
- **Responsive design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

### 4. Integration with Existing System ✅
- **Preserves grommets**: SVG-based grommets and guides remain visible
- **Maintains banner dimensions**: Proper aspect ratio and sizing
- **PDF support**: PDFs still work with existing preview system
- **Upload button alignment**: Center-aligned as required

## Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Open the site**: http://localhost:8080
2. **Navigate to design page**: Click 'Design Your Banner' or similar
3. **Upload an image**: Use JPG, PNG, or JPEG file
4. **Test interactivity**:
   - Click on the uploaded image to select it
   - Verify blue selection ring appears
   - Verify toolbar with 4 buttons appears (Zoom In, Zoom Out, Rotate, Reset)
5. **Test controls**:
   - Click Zoom In button multiple times - image should scale up
   - Click Zoom Out button - image should scale down
   - Click Rotate button - image should rotate 90 degrees
   - Drag the image around - it should move within the canvas
   - Click Reset button - image should return to original state
6. **Test deselection**: Click outside the image - selection ring and toolbar should disappear
7. **Verify info panel**: Check that transform info shows current scale % and rotation degrees

## Technical Implementation:

- **InteractiveImageEditor.tsx**: New component handling all interactive functionality
- **PreviewCanvas.tsx**: Updated to use hybrid SVG + interactive image approach
- **LivePreviewCard.tsx**: Maintains existing upload functionality with center-aligned buttons
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces
- **Performance**: Optimized with useCallback and proper event handling
- **Mobile support**: Touch events supported for mobile devices

The implementation successfully provides VistaPrint-style interactive image editing while maintaining all existing functionality and requirements.
