# From Flea Markets to Food Festivals: How Dano's Seasoning Grew with the Right Banners

## Seasoning Stand Out

When you walk through a busy food festival or trade show, one thing catches your eye before the smell of the food does — **the banners**.

For food brands and food truck owners, that first impression is everything. The right banner doesn't just tell people what's on the menu — it tells them **who you are**.

At **Banners on the Fly**, we know this better than most because we've lived it.

## A 30-Year Legacy in Banner Printing

My business partner, **John**, has been printing banners for more than 30 years. Over those decades, he's seen small businesses rise from simple setups at flea markets to major players at national trade shows. And through it all, one thing has stayed the same — **quality banners that show up on time make a difference**.

One of John's earliest and proudest partnerships was with **Dan Oliver**, founder of **Dano's Seasoning**.

Back when Dano was just getting started, he didn't have national distribution or fancy displays. He had a table, some samples, and a vision. John printed his very first banners — the same banners that hung behind Dan at flea markets, local events, and small pop-ups. Those early banners helped Dano's booth stand out, draw a crowd, and build a loyal following.

**Fast-forward to today**, and Dano's Seasoning is a nationally recognized brand, found in major retailers like **Walmart, Kroger, and Costco** — and John still provides his banners for trade shows across the country.
