When it comes to designing an eye-catching banner, what you print on it is only half the equation. The size of your banner can make the difference between being noticed from across the street or being overlooked entirely.

At Banners on the Fly, we've seen it all — from massive trade show backdrops to small storefront displays — and one of the most common questions we get is:

**"What size banner should I order?"**

Choosing the right banner size isn't complicated, but it does depend on a few key factors: location, purpose, visibility, and environment. Let's break it down.

---

## 🏢 1. Determine Where Your Banner Will Be Displayed

Before anything else, consider where your banner will hang.  
The space available will guide both the size and orientation (horizontal vs. vertical).

### For indoor use:

**6' × 2' or 8' × 3' banners** are ideal for trade show booths, event tables, or product displays.

If your banner is replacing signage or branding inside a business, make sure it fits proportionally to walls or backdrops without overcrowding.

### For outdoor use:

Go bigger. Outdoor banners are competing with more visual noise — cars, people, and distance.

**10' × 4' or 12' × 5' banners** are great for storefronts, fences, and construction sites.

For large events or festivals, banners can reach **20 feet or more** for maximum visibility.

**Remember:** a banner should look intentional, not like an afterthought. Measure your space before ordering so you know exactly what will fit and stand out.

## 📐 2. Think About Viewing Distance

The further away people are when they see your banner, the bigger your text and graphics need to be.

### As a general rule:

**For every 10 feet of viewing distance, make your lettering at least 1 inch tall.**

**Example:** if you want your banner readable from 100 feet away, your letters should be around 10 inches tall.

If your banner is hanging high (like on a fence, pole, or stage backdrop), size up for extra visibility.

### A simple tip:

**When in doubt, go bigger.** You can always make a big banner look balanced — but a banner that's too small will disappear.

## ⚙️ 3. Choose Orientation: Horizontal vs. Vertical

**Horizontal banners** are the standard — perfect for fences, storefronts, and across booths.

**Vertical banners** are ideal for tight spaces or to stand alongside a doorway or display.

For trade shows, you might even use both: a horizontal backdrop banner and a vertical pull-up banner beside your table for added visibility.

## 🎨 4. Consider Design Elements and Readability

Once you've chosen the size, your design should match it.  
Leave plenty of "breathing room" around your logo and text — especially for outdoor banners where people only have a few seconds to read it.

### Pro tip:

**Avoid clutter.** A clear, simple message ("Now Open," "Visit Our Booth," "Grand Opening This Weekend") will outperform a wall of text every time.

Also, think about **contrast** — bright colors on dark backgrounds (and vice versa) ensure your banner pops in any lighting.

---

## 🌬️ 5. Account for Wind and Weather

If your banner will hang outdoors in a windy area, size isn't the only factor — **material matters too**.  
Larger banners act like sails, catching wind and adding stress to grommets and supports.

In these cases, consider using a **mesh banner**, which allows air to pass through while maintaining visibility. (We broke this down in detail in our blog ["Vinyl vs. Mesh Banners"](/blog/vinyl-vs-mesh-banners-guide).)

Here are a few standard banner sizes and where they work best:

| Size (Feet) | Best For |
|-------------|----------|

| Custom Sizes | Tailored to fit any specific event or unique layout |

## ⚡️ Bringing It All Together

Choosing the perfect banner size is about balancing **visibility, space, and purpose**.  
Start with where your banner will go, think about how far away people will be when they see it, and pick the dimensions that make your message impossible to miss.
