## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Still Needs Work

### **QuickQuote Component** - NEEDS AMAZON REDESIGN

**Current Issues:**
- Heavy blue/indigo/purple gradients everywhere
- Decorative background patterns
- Too many colors (blue, green, purple, pink, orange)
- Overly complex styling with shadows and blur effects
- Doesn't match Amazon's clean aesthetic

**What Amazon-Style Would Look Like:**
1. **Main Section**: White background instead of gradient
2. **Headers**: Simple text instead of gradient text
3. **Cards**: White with subtle slate-200 borders
4. **Section Headers**: Light slate-50 background, no gradients
5. **Icons**: Consistent orange-500 backgrounds
6. **Buttons**: Simple white with slate borders, orange focus rings
7. **Inputs**: Clean white fields with orange focus states
8. **No decorative elements**: Remove blur effects, pulse dots, gradient overlays

## üé® Amazon Design Principles Applied

- **Clean white backgrounds** - No gradients
- **Subtle borders** - slate-200 for separation
- **Consistent orange accents** - Your brand color
- **Simple typography** - No gradient text
- **Minimal shadows** - Just shadow-sm for depth
- **Scannable layout** - Clear hierarchy
- **Professional** - Product-focused, not flashy

## üìù Recommendation

The QuickQuote component is complex (793 lines) and sed scripts keep breaking it. 

**Best Approach:**
I can create a brand new Amazon-style QuickQuote component from scratch that:
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Uses clean Amazon-style design
- Has consistent orange branding
- Matches the rest of your homepage

This would be safer than trying to transform the existing component with find/replace operations.

**Would you like me to:**
1. Create a new Amazon-style QuickQuote from scratch?
2. Try a more targeted manual approach using the str-replace-editor tool?
3. Leave QuickQuote as-is for now and focus on other pages?
