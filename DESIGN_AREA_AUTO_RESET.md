# ✅ Design Area Auto-Reset Feature

## Summary
After a user adds a banner to the cart, the design area now automatically clears and resets to default values, preparing for the next design. The user receives a confirmation toast message before the reset occurs.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Quote Store (`src/store/quote.ts`)**
Added a new `resetDesign()` method that clears all design settings:

```typescript
resetDesign: () => set({
  widthIn: 48,
  heightIn: 24,
  quantity: 1,
  material: '13oz',
  grommets: 'none',
  polePockets: 'none',
  polePocketSize: '2',
  addRope: false,
  previewScalePct: 100,
  textElements: [],
  editingItemId: null,
  file: undefined,
  overlayImage: undefined,
})
```

**What gets reset:**
- ✅ Banner dimensions (back to 48" x 24")
- ✅ Material selection (back to 13oz)
- ✅ Quantity (back to 1)
- ✅ Grommets (back to none)
- ✅ Pole pockets (back to none)
- ✅ Rope option (back to false)
- ✅ All text elements (cleared)
- ✅ Uploaded artwork file (cleared)
- ✅ Overlay images (cleared)
- ✅ Editing state (cleared)

### 2. **Add to Cart Button (`src/components/design/AddToCartButton.tsx`)**
Modified to call `resetDesign()` after successful cart operations:

**For adding new items:**
```typescript
toast({
  title: "Added to Cart",
  description: "Your banner design has been added to the cart.",
});

// Reset design area after successful add
quote.resetDesign();
```

**For updating existing items:**
```typescript
toast({
  title: "Cart Updated",
  description: "Your banner design has been updated in the cart.",
});

// Reset design area after successful update
quote.resetDesign();
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **User designs a banner** (uploads artwork, sets dimensions, selects options)
2. **User clicks "Add to Cart"**
3. **Success toast appears** → "Added to Cart - Your banner design has been added to the cart."
4. **Design area automatically clears** → Ready for next banner
5. **User can immediately start designing another banner**

## Benefits

✅ **Faster workflow** - No manual clearing needed between designs
✅ **Clear confirmation** - Toast message confirms the item was added
✅ **Prevents confusion** - Fresh slate for each new design
✅ **Reduces errors** - Users won't accidentally modify the wrong design
✅ **Professional UX** - Similar to e-commerce best practices
