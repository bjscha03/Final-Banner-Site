# ✅ Site Restored and Working!

## What Happened

The QuickQuote component had a syntax error from our sed replacements that broke the JSX structure.

## Fix Applied

Restored the QuickQuote component from git:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- src/components/home/QuickQuote.tsx
```

## Current Status

✅ **Site is now working!**
- Homepage loads correctly
- All components functional
- Company Spotlight image displays properly
- Testimonials with images restored
- QuickQuote back to original (working) state

## What's Still Applied

The following components have the new Amazon-style design:
- ✅ HeroSection - Clean Amazon-style layout
- ✅ CompanySpotlight - Fixed image, clean card design
- ✅ TestimonialsSection - Original testimonials with images, new styling
- ✅ WhyChooseUs - Clean feature grid

## QuickQuote Status

The QuickQuote component is back to its **original working state** from git. 

**Note:** The color changes we attempted broke the component structure. To update QuickQuote safely, we would need to:
1. Make targeted, careful edits using the str-replace-editor tool
2. Test after each change
3. Avoid bulk sed replacements that can break JSX structure

## View Your Site

**Dev server:** http://localhost:8080

The site should be fully functional now!

**Recommendation:** Let's keep the QuickQuote as-is for now since it's working. We can focus on other pages or make very targeted improvements to QuickQuote if needed.
