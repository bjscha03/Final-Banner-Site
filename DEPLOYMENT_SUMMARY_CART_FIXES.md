## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Mobile - Cart Auto-Expanding on Page Navigation ✅

**Problem**:
- Cart summary panel automatically expanded every time user navigated to a new page
- Blocked content and created poor user experience
- Users had to manually close cart on every page load

**Root Cause**:
- `useEffect` hook detecting item additions triggered on component mount/remount
- When `prevItemCount` initialized to 0 and cart had items, condition `itemCount > prevItemCount` was true
- This caused cart to auto-expand on every page navigation

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Added check: prevItemCount > 0
if (itemCount > prevItemCount && prevItemCount > 0) {
  setIsExpanded(true);
}
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Cart stays collapsed on page navigation
- ✅ Cart only auto-expands when item is actually added
- ✅ Much better mobile user experience

---

### Issue 2: Desktop - Cart Item Count Badge Not Displaying ✅

**Problem**:
- Minimized desktop cart icon didn't show badge with item count
- Desktop users couldn't see how many items were in cart without expanding
- Mobile had badge, but desktop didn't (inconsistent UX)

**Root Cause**:
- Minimized desktop button missing `relative` positioning class
- Badge component itself was missing (present on mobile but not desktop)

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Added relative class and badge component
<button className="relative bg-gradient-to-r...">
  <ShoppingCart className="h-5 w-5" />
  {itemCount > 0 && (
    <span className="absolute -top-2 -right-2 bg-orange-500...">
      {itemCount}
    </span>
  )}
</button>
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Desktop cart icon now shows orange badge with item count
- ✅ Badge updates in real-time as items added/removed
- ✅ Consistent experience across mobile and desktop
